# branch-pull-merge-repeat-project
Once upon a time there was a group of 4 young professionals working on a project. They were determined to hit a gold mine by flying over mars. But first they had to build the ship. However, they did not have the funds to build the ship.
So instead, they ended up working on their Github project for the rest of the period. One day the group found some space pirates that were looking for a crew. So they came down to earth and asked the young professionals to be apart of their crew. So they joined them and went off to Mars. When they arrived, the pirates decided to over charge them for the trip. They asked them to give up 1/4 of their food supply. 
Instead the young professionals said screw that, and ended up going home and living happily ever after
